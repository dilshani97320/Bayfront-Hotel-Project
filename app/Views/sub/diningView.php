Guests get to mix their own spices, season their ingredients and cook their own lunch, under the watchful eye and instruction of Chef Ranil. The experience is not a typical “demo” but an interactive learning on how to make some of our favourite and most popular dishes. However, it is safe to say that guest ability behind the stove will not obstruct an exquisite Sri Lankan “rice & curry” lunch from being presented to guests.</p>

Calm and quiet place with good service. However, the place is actually outside the container facing pool and mirissa sea. Their food menu was limited but food is perfect. Perfect location for catch up with some friends. ”</p>
